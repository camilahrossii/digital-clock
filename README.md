<h2>:date: About this project</h2>

 The Digital Clock is a Front End application made with the intention of improving my Javascript skills.

The project consists of showing the user the current time and also showing the period.

I used conditions so that according to the period of the day the application wishes the user a 'Good Morning', 'Good Afternoon', 'Good Evening' and 'Good Night' and changes the background according to the images above.
